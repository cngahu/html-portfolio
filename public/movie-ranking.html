<h3>The Blacklist</h3>
<p>If you want a masterpiece of the envisionage of crime, then look no further. Red, commonly referred to
    brings out the persona of more than a criminal. He plays the role so well that he brings me to
    think that even crime has a passion.

<h3>The Equalizer 2</h3>
<p>Whenever I see Denzel Washington on this, I always think of being a vigilante.
    Have you ever had that self confidence within you, where you could be the 
    good samaritan everywhere and at leastoffer your assistance in today's current crisis. If not, think about it.

<h3>The Sentinel</h3>
<p>Back in the days, with my cousin, the fight
    for survival always hides the senses we may not
    even know exist
